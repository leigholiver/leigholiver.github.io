# Hi, Iâ€™m Leigh
I'm currently employed as a Platform Engineer but I've worn a few hats in DevOps and Software Development.

In my day-to-day I'm usually:
- Helping developers deploy features faster, with less friction
- Engineering scalable, fault-tolerant and cost effective cloud infrastructure for web applications
- Hacking on tools and automation to make peoples work easier
